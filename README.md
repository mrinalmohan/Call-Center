# Call-Center
Created a call center program, which can connect to the database, process the data and print the output on the console. 

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of Core Java programming language to build a call center application that can interact with a database.


The project uses the following technologies:

Core Java ||
JDBC ||
MySql Database

This project uses the following libraries:

» MySQL Connector/J - for JDBC driver to connect to MySQL database


The project has the following features:

» This project uses JDBC API to connect to the database and fetch the data. <br>

» It then processes the data using Java streams and prints the output on the console. <br>

» Database connection: The project connects to a database using MySql.

» Data processing: The project retrieves data from the database, processes it, and prints the output on the console.

» Console output: The project prints the processed data on the console.

The output of the console is as follows:
